<p class="centered"> The Eiffel Tower began being constructed on January 26th 1887, it was finished <br>
    in two years. The tower was constructed to be wind resistant so it wouldnt frail over time. <br>
    It was intended to be put together by bolts but builders noticed that rivets would expand when <br>
    they cooled down for a more secure fit. Evreyone hated the idea of the tower at first but quickley <br>
    saw how cool it was and started to like it.
